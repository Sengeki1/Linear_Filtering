# OpenCV Algorithms for Image Processing

This repository contains a collection of image processing algorithms implemented using OpenCV. The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for testing, studying, and experimenting with various image processing techniques.

## Features
- Implementation of fundamental image processing operations
- Advanced filtering and transformations
- Edge detection, thresholding
- Image enhancement and restoration
- Color space manipulation

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the algorithms:

```sh
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sengeki1/opencv-algorithms.git
cd opencv-algorithms
```

Run a specific algorithm using Python:

```sh
python scripts/algorithm_name.py
```
